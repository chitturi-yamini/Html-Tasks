      <hr>

       <p>The Jagannath Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Jagannath, a form of Vishnu in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism"title="hindusim"target"_puri">eastern coast</a>. It is located in Puri in the state of Odisha, situated on the eastern coast of India. As per temple records, King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indradyumna"tittle="indrayumna"target"_jaganadh">hindhu litrature</a> of Avanti built the main temple of Jagannath at Puri.The present temple was rebuilt from the tenth century onwards, on the site of the pre-existing temples in the compound, but not the main Jagannath temple, and begun by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anantavarman Chodaganga"title="anantavarman"target="_chodaganaga">eastern ganga</a>, the first king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.</p>

     <p>The temple is sacred to all Hindus, and especially in those of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnavism"titlte="vaishnav"target=_"vaishnavisam">hindhu denominations</a> traditions. Many great Vaishnava saints, such as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, Vallabhacharya and Ramananda were closely associated with the temple.[8][9] Ramanuja established the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emar_Matha"title="emar"target="_mata">kalikadevi sahi</a> in the south-eastern corner of the temple, and Adi Shankaracharya established the Govardhan Math, which is the seat of one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara"title="shankara"target="four">vedic scholor</a></p>.

   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhadra"title="subhadra"target="_devi>princes if dwraka</a> and Balabhadra are a trio of deities worshipped at the temple. The inner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbhagriha"title="garbha"target="_griha">jain temples</a> of the temple contains the deities of them carved from sacred neem logs, known as daru sitting on the bejewelled platform or ratnabedi, along with the deities of Sudarshana Chakra, Madanmohan, Sridevi and<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhumi_(goddess)"title="bhumi"target="_goddess">varaha avathar</a>.[18] The deities are adorned with different clothing and jewels according to the season. Worship of these deities predates the building of the temple, and may have originated in an ancient tribal shrine.

   <p>Non-Hindus (excluding)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"title="singhs"target="_buddhas">buddha drama</a> and foreigners are not permitted to enter the temple.[29][30] Such a rule is believed to exist ever since the temple was built, and at present, it often becomes a subject to controversy and debates that have lasted for several decades.[31][32][33] According to <a hre+"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganeshi_Lal"title="lal"target="_ganesh">sirsa hariyana</a>, the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Odisha"title="governer"target="_oddissa">head of state</a>, foreigners can enter the temple only if he/she can meet the Gajapati servitors and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shankaracharya"title="acahrya"target="_shankaracharyulu">adi shankara</a>, then he/she could also be allowed to witness Jagannath. But, this theory has not wielded influence yet, and continues to be a subject of longstanding debate.[34] The temple is open everyday from 5:00 am to 10:30 pm.
